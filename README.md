## 🚀 Quick Start

### Breaking Changes (v1.0.0)
- Replaced top-level command `jira` with `tasks`
- Replaced top-level command `bitbucket` with separate `repo` and `pullrequest` command groups
- Removed `bitbucket test-auth` (authentication now implicitly verified on other commands)
- Updated pull request subcommands to concise verbs: `list`, `show`, `create`, `mine`

Update any scripts referencing old commands accordingly (e.g. `devflow jira list` -> `devflow tasks list`).

### 1. Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd devflow

# Install to your Go bin directory (recommended)
make install

# Ensure ~/go/bin is in your PATH (add to ~/.bashrc if needed)
export PATH="$HOME/go/bin:$PATH"
```

**Note:** Version is injected at build time. The source file `cmd/version.go` intentionally sets `var version = "dev"`; release builds override this via `-ldflags "-X 'devflow/cmd.version=vX.Y.Z'"` (see Makefile). `make install` installs the binary to `~/go/bin/devflow` embedding the latest git tag release version. For development builds (`make build`) the CLI will report `dev`. To install a specific tagged release: `make install VERSION=v1.3.3`. Avoid manually editing `version.go` for releases.

### 2. Configuration

Set up your API credentials:

```bash
# Jira configuration
./devflow config set jira.url https://your-domain.atlassian.net
./devflow config set jira.username your-email@example.com
./devflow config set jira.token your-jira-api-token

# Bitbucket configuration (optional)
./devflow config set bitbucket.workspace your-workspace
./devflow config set bitbucket.username your-username
./devflow config set bitbucket.token your-bitbucket-api-token

# Jenkins configuration (optional)
./devflow config set jenkins.url https://jenkins.example.com
./devflow config set jenkins.username your-username
./devflow config set jenkins.token your-jenkins-api-token
```

### 3. Get Your API Tokens

#### Jira API Token
1. Go to [Atlassian Account Settings](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)
2. Create a new API token
3. Copy the token value
4. Use with: `./devflow config set jira.token YOUR_JIRA_TOKEN`

#### Bitbucket API Token
**⚠️ Important:** Bitbucket now uses API tokens instead of app passwords. These are DIFFERENT from Jira tokens!

1. Go to [Bitbucket Settings > API tokens](https://bitbucket.org/account/settings/api-tokens)
2. Click "Create API token"
3. Give it a name (e.g., "CLI Tool")
4. Select these scopes:
   - ✅ **Pull requests**: Read
   - ✅ **Repositories**: Read
   - ✅ **Webhooks**: Read and write (if needed)
5. Click "Create"
6. **📋 COPY the generated API token immediately** (shown only once!)
7. Use with: `./devflow config set bitbucket.token YOUR_BITBUCKET_API_TOKEN`

**🔍 Token Format Difference:**
- **Jira tokens:** Start with `ATATT3x...` (Atlassian format)
- **Bitbucket personal API tokens (user-level):** Used with Basic auth (email + token)
- **Bitbucket resource access tokens (workspace/project/repo):** Used with Bearer auth (Authorization: Bearer <token>)

**Auth Selection Logic:**
- If you set `bitbucket.username` (your email), DevFlow uses Basic auth.
- If you leave `bitbucket.username` empty, DevFlow assumes a resource access token and uses Bearer.

**❗ Common Mistake:** Don't use a Jira token for Bitbucket - they are completely different!

**📅 Migration Note:** App passwords deprecated Sep 9 2025 and disabled Jun 9 2026. Use personal API tokens (Basic) or resource access tokens (Bearer).

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Git Utilities (Local Repositories)

List and inspect the sync status of all git repositories under a directory (recursively). Shows branch, sync state, dirtiness, ahead/behind counts (approximate), and upstream tracking branch.

Default output now streams each repository line-by-line as soon as it is processed (faster feedback on large trees). Use `--tabular` to wait for all results and render the full table. JSON remains available with `--json`.

```bash
# Basic usage (current directory) - streaming lines: path<TAB>branch<TAB>state
./devflow git list

# Specify a root path to scan
./devflow git list --path ~/code

# Skip fetching remotes (faster, may be stale)
./devflow git list --no-fetch

# Full table (waits for all repos)
./devflow git list --tabular

# JSON output for scripting
./devflow git list --json > repos.json
```

Sample streaming lines:
```
api	main	up-to-date
web	featureX	ahead
infra/terraform/modules/network	main	behind
tools/old-experiment	DETACHED	detached
sandbox/prototype	main	no-upstream
```

Sample table output (`--tabular`):
```
┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃ Repository                           ┃ Branch   ┃ State      ┃ Dirty ┃ Stashed ┃ Ahead ┃ Behind ┃ Upstream     ┃
┣━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╋━━━━━━━━━━╋━━━━━━━━━━━━╋━━━━━━━╋━━━━━━━━━╋━━━━━━━╋━━━━━━━╋━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┫
┃ api                                  ┃ main     ┃ up-to-date ┃ clean ┃ no      ┃ 0     ┃ 0      ┃ origin/main  ┃
┃ web                                  ┃ featureX ┃ ahead      ┃ dirty ┃ yes     ┃ 2     ┃ 0      ┃ origin/main  ┃
┃ infra/terraform/modules/network      ┃ main     ┃ behind     ┃ clean ┃ no      ┃ 0     ┃ 3      ┃ origin/main  ┃
┃ tools/old-experiment                 ┃ DETACHED ┃ detached   ┃ clean ┃ no      ┃ 0     ┃ 0      ┃              ┃
┃ sandbox/prototype                    ┃ main     ┃ no-upstream┃ dirty ┃ no      ┃ 0     ┃ 0      ┃              ┃
┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┻━━━━━━━━━━┻━━━━━━━━━━━━┻━━━━━━━┻━━━━━━━━━┻━━━━━━━┻━━━━━━━┻━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛
```

States:
- up-to-date: Local and upstream commit match
- ahead: Local has commits not on upstream
- behind: Upstream has commits not local
- diverged: Both sides have unique commits
- no-upstream: Branch has no configured tracking branch
- detached: HEAD is detached (not on a named branch)

Dirty indicates uncommitted changes in the worktree.

Ahead/Behind Accuracy Note:
The counts use a bounded ancestor traversal (max 2000 commits each side) rather than a true merge-base calculation; for very large, divergent histories counts are approximate but state classification (ahead/behind/diverged) remains reliable.


### Task Commands (formerly Jira)

#### List Your Tasks
```bash
# Basic list of your assigned tasks (includes direct links)
./devflow tasks list
# Output includes 🔗 https://your-domain.atlassian.net/browse/ISSUE-KEY

# Focus on active work (exclude completed tasks)
./devflow tasks list --exclude-done

# Show priority information
./devflow tasks list --exclude-done --priority

# Filter by specific status
./devflow tasks list --filter "In Progress"

# Sort by priority (highest first)
./devflow tasks list --exclude-done --sort priority --priority

# Combine multiple options
./devflow tasks list --exclude-done --sort priority --priority
```

#### Show Issue Details
```bash
# Get comprehensive details about a specific issue
./devflow tasks show ISSUE-123

# Example output includes:
# - Issue summary and key
# - Status with icon
# - Priority with icon
# - Assignee and reporter
# - Assigned Team (if present)
# - Created and updated dates
# - Full description
# - All comments with timestamps
# - Attachments with file sizes
```

#### Find Mentions
```bash
# Find all issues where you're mentioned
./devflow tasks mentioned

# Searches through:
# - Comments (@username mentions)
# - Issue descriptions
# - All text fields
```

#### Create New Tasks
```bash
# Minimum (project key is required)
./devflow tasks create -p ENG "Fix login bug"

# With common metadata
./devflow tasks create -p ENG "Implement search API" \
  --type Story \
  --priority High \
  --assignee alice \
  --labels backend,api,search \
  --epic ENG-42 \
  --story-points 3 \
  --sprint Sprint-24 \
  --team 11843 \
  --description "Adds new search endpoint with filtering"

# Use a file for the description (mutually exclusive with --description)
./devflow tasks create -p ENG "Refactor caching layer" --description-file docs/specs/cache-refactor.md
```

Flags:
- `-p, --project` (required): Jira project key (e.g. ENG, OPS)
- `-t, --type`: Issue type (Task, Story, Bug, etc.; defaults to Task)
- `--priority`: Priority name (Highest, High, Medium, Low, Lowest)
- `--assignee`: Assignee username (may need accountId in some Jira Cloud setups)
- `--labels`: Comma-separated labels (e.g. backend,api,urgent)
- `--epic`: Epic key to link (depends on Jira setup / classic vs next-gen)
- `--story-points`: Numeric estimate (mapped to a common story points custom field)
- `--sprint`: Sprint name or ID (instance-specific custom field)
- `--team`: Team ID or name (maps to custom team field; accepts numeric id or exact team name)
- `-d, --description`: Inline description text
- `--description-file`: Path to a file whose contents become the description

Notes:
- Do not supply both `--description` and `--description-file` (command will error).
- Epic, Story Points, Sprint, and Team rely on specific custom field IDs which may differ in your Jira instance; if they do, creation may fail until field IDs are aligned in code (future enhancement: configurable field IDs).
- The Team field accepts either the numeric ID (preferred) or the exact team name. If Jira rejects the value, the CLI automatically retries without the team field (logged in output).
- Assignee resolution using `name` may not work on all Jira Cloud instances that require `accountId` (planned improvement).

#### Comment on an Issue
```bash
# Add a simple comment
./devflow tasks comment ISSUE-123 "This is now unblocked after deploying service X"

# Use a file for a longer comment (supports markdown-ish formatting rendered as ADF)
./devflow tasks comment ISSUE-123 --file docs/notes/analysis.md
```

#### Add a Remote Link
```bash
# Link an external spec document
./devflow tasks link ISSUE-123 https://docs.internal/specs/auth-redesign.md \
  --title "Auth Redesign Spec" \
  --summary "Initial design draft for new authentication flow"

# Minimal (just URL)
./devflow tasks link ISSUE-123 https://example.com/incident/postmortem-42
```

### Pull Request & Repo Commands

#### PR Diff (New)
View the unified diff for a pull request:
```bash
./devflow pullrequest diff your-repo-name 123
```

#### PR Comments (Enhanced)
List all comments with thread organization and resolution status:
```bash
./devflow pullrequest comments your-repo-name 123
# Shows:
# - Thread ID for each comment
# - Resolution status (✅ RESOLVED / ⚠️ UNRESOLVED)
# - File and line numbers for inline comments
# - Nested replies within threads
```

#### PR Comment Reply (New)
Reply to a specific comment thread:
```bash
./devflow pullrequest comment-reply your-repo-name 123 456 "Thanks for the feedback!"
# Where 456 is the thread ID from the comments list
```

#### Set PR Status with AI Review Key
When using the AI reviewer, set status with the key `ai-review`:
```bash
devflow pullrequest set-status your-repo-name a1b2c3d4e5f6 \
  --state SUCCESSFUL \
  --key ai-review \
  --description "AI review passed"
```

#### Show Repository README (New)
Display the README for a Bitbucket repository (tries common filename variants)
```bash
./devflow repo readme my-repo
./devflow repo readme my-repo --raw   # raw contents only (no header)
```

#### Watched Repositories (New)
Mark repositories as "watched" to scope pull request commands.

Interactive selection (refactored raw key navigation):
```bash
./devflow repo list --interactive
# Keys:
#   Up/Down: move selection
#   Space/Enter: toggle watch for highlighted repo
#   Left/Right: previous/next page
#   w: jump to currently watched repos page
#   g: go to page (then enter number)
#   s: save & exit
#   q: quit without saving
```

Show clone endpoints:
```bash
# Show HTTPS and SSH URLs (labeled)
./devflow repo remotes my-repo

# Only SSH (raw URL output)
./devflow repo remotes --ssh my-repo

# Only HTTPS (raw URL output)
./devflow repo remotes --https my-repo
```

Search repositories:
```bash
# Regex match on repository name (case-insensitive by default)
./devflow repo search 'api-.*'

# Case sensitive
./devflow repo search --case-sensitive 'API-[A-Z]+'

# Include description in the match
./devflow repo search -d 'terraform'
```

Direct watch management commands:
```bash
# Add/remove/toggle/list watched repos
./devflow repo watch add <repo-slug>
./devflow repo watch remove <repo-slug>
./devflow repo watch toggle <repo-slug>
./devflow repo watch list
```

Watched repo slugs are stored (sorted) under `bitbucket.watched_repos` in `~/.devflow/config.json`.

Current PR command behavior (scoped to watched repos):
```bash
# List PRs in a specific watched repo (fails if not watched)
./devflow pullrequest list --repo my-repo

# Aggregate PRs across all watched repos
./devflow pullrequest list

# Output in JSON format (for scripts/automation)
./devflow pullrequest list --json
./devflow pullrequest list --repo my-repo --json

# PRs where you are author (watched repos unless --all-repos)
./devflow pullrequest mine                # aggregate across watched
./devflow pullrequest mine --repo my-repo # single watched repo
./devflow pullrequest mine --all-repos    # workspace-wide (ignores watch list)

# PRs you participate in (author/reviewer) across watched repos
./devflow pullrequest participating       # aggregate across watched
./devflow pullrequest participating --repo my-repo
```


```bash
# List pull requests (includes direct links)
./devflow pullrequest list --repo your-repo-name
# Output includes 🔗 https://bitbucket.org/workspace/repo/pull-requests/ID

# Create a pull request (description, reviewers, auto-detect branches, browser open)
./devflow pullrequest create "Feature implementation" --repo your-repo-name -m "Implements feature X" -R alice -R bob --open

# Show build/status checks for all commits in a pull request
./devflow pullrequest builds your-repo-name 123
# Example output:
# Fetching commits for PR #123 in your-repo-name...
# Found 2 commits. Fetching statuses...
# Commit 1/2: a1b2c3d4e5f6 - Add integration test
# Author: Alice <alice@example.com>  Date: 2025-10-20T14:22:11+00:00
#   🔄 INPROGRESS - build (ci/pipeline)
#     Running CI pipeline
#     🔗 https://bitbucket.org/workspace/your-repo-name/addon/pipelines/home#!/results/123
#     Updated: 3m ago
#   ✅ SUCCESSFUL - lint (lint/check)
#     Updated: 3m ago
#
# Commit 2/2: 0f1e2d3c4b5a - Refactor handlers
# Author: Bob <bob@example.com>  Date: 2025-10-20T15:02:48+00:00
#   ✅ SUCCESSFUL - build (ci/pipeline)
#     🔗 https://bitbucket.org/workspace/your-repo-name/addon/pipelines/home#!/results/124
#     Updated: 2m ago
#
# Status Key: value in parentheses (e.g. ci/pipeline) is the unique upsert key to reuse with `pullrequest set-status`.
# If a status shows only one value (no parentheses) key == name.
# To discover a key outside the CLI, open the Bitbucket Pipelines build/log page; the key often matches the pipeline step or integration identifier.
# Status Icons Legend:
#   ✅ SUCCESSFUL   ❌ FAILED/ERROR   🔄 INPROGRESS/PENDING   🚫 STOPPED/CANCELLED   📝 Other
# (Authentication is validated automatically when running other commands)
```

#### Set or Update a Commit Status (New)
Create or update a build/deployment/check status for a specific commit (upsert by key):
```bash
devflow pullrequest set-status your-repo-name a1b2c3d4e5f6 \
  --state SUCCESSFUL \
  --key ci/pipeline \
  --description "All tests passed"
```
States: SUCCESSFUL, FAILED, INPROGRESS, STOPPED, ERROR, PENDING, CANCELLED
Reusing the same `--key` updates the existing status entry.
If you omit --name or --url they will be reused from an existing status (if present) or default (name=key). --description is optional; omit it to keep existing text.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "API request failed with status: 400"
- Check your Jira URL - it should be `https://your-domain.atlassian.net` (without `/jira`)
- Verify your API token is correct
- Ensure your username is your email address

#### "API request failed with status: 401"
- Your API token may be expired or incorrect
- Check that you're using the correct token type (Jira API token, not Bitbucket)

#### "API request failed with status: 410"
- The API endpoint has changed - the CLI automatically handles this

#### Configuration not found
- Run the configuration commands again
- Check that `~/.devflow/config.json` exists

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable verbose output (future feature)
./devflow --verbose tasks list
```

## 🛠️ Development

### Session Summaries

Development session summaries are maintained in [`docs/sessions/`](docs/sessions/) to provide context continuity between development sessions. These summaries document:

- Feature implementation details and architectural decisions
- API integration patterns and authentication flows
- CLI design choices and user experience considerations
- Key technical insights and lessons learned  
- Implementation approach and rationale
- Files modified and their purposes
- Test coverage and validation approach

This helps maintain context for future development work and provides valuable historical information about the project's evolution, especially important for a tool that integrates with multiple external APIs.
