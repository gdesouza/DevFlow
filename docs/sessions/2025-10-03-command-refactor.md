# 2025-10-03 Command Refactor

## Summary
Refactored top-level CLI commands to improve clarity and task orientation:
- Replaced `jira` with `tasks`
- Replaced `bitbucket` with two focused groups: `repo` (repository operations) and `pullrequest` (pull request operations, aliases: `pr`, `pullrequests`, `prs`)
- Removed obsolete `bitbucket test-auth` command
- Updated interactive setup messaging to point to new commands

## Rationale
Splitting Bitbucket functionality clarifies the distinction between repository metadata and pull request workflow. Renaming `jira` to `tasks` aligns terminology with user intent (managing work items) and keeps vendor specifics out of everyday command usage. This improves discoverability and future‑proofs the interface if additional task providers are added.

## Changes Implemented
- `cmd/root.go`: Added `tasksCmd`, `repoCmd`, `pullrequestCmd`; removed old `jiraCmd`/`bitbucketCmd` wiring.
- `cmd/jira.go`: Internal command renamed to `tasksCmd` (file rename pending for follow‑up to avoid large diff churn right now).
- `cmd/bitbucket.go`: Replaced with separate command groups; attached existing subcommands to appropriate parents; removed registration of `test-auth`.
- PR subcommand `Use` strings normalized to concise verbs: `list`, `show`, `create`, `mine`.
- `cmd/config_setup.go`: Updated user guidance lines.
- `docs/sessions/2025-09-23-initial-implementation.md`: Unchanged (historical context retained).

## Outstanding Work
1. README updates to reflect new command names and structure (in progress next session).
2. File renames (`jira.go` -> `tasks.go`, possibly split `bitbucket.go`) and README project tree sync.
3. Optional deprecation shim commands (`jira`, `bitbucket`) if backward compatibility desired.
4. Global search & replace of old invocation examples in README and any docs.
5. Build & test verification after file removals.

## Migration Notes
Former commands map as follows:
- `devflow jira list` -> `devflow tasks list`
- `devflow jira show KEY` -> `devflow tasks show KEY`
- `devflow jira mentioned` -> `devflow tasks mentioned`
- `devflow jira create ...` -> `devflow tasks create ...`
- `devflow bitbucket list-prs --repo X` -> `devflow pullrequest list --repo X`
- `devflow bitbucket create-pr ...` -> `devflow pullrequest create ...`
- `devflow bitbucket my-prs` -> `devflow pullrequest mine`
- `devflow bitbucket list-repos` (if existed) -> `devflow repo list`
- `devflow bitbucket test-auth` -> removed (auth implicitly validated by other commands)

## Future Considerations
- Introduce `tasks search` for broader JQL queries.
- Add caching of recent repo and PR lookups.
- Consider provider abstraction to allow multiple task backends.

## Validation Plan
After README updates and file renames:
- Run `make build` and `make test`.
- Manually execute: `devflow tasks list --help`, `devflow repo list --help`, `devflow pullrequest list --help`.
