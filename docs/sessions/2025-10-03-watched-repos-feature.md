# Session: Watched Repositories & Participating PR Aggregation
**Date**: 2025-10-03
**Duration**: ~1.5 hours
**Participants**: User, Assistant

## Objectives
- Introduce "watched repositories" concept to scope PR-related commands
- Add interactive, keyboard-driven repository selection UI
- Aggregate PR listings (list/mine/participating) across watched repos
- Support listing PRs the user participates in (author/reviewer)
- Refine Bitbucket authentication (Basic vs Bearer) selection logic
- Update documentation to reflect new behavior

## Key Decisions
- **Watched Repo Set in Config**: Added `bitbucket.watched_repos` (sorted slice) to persist curated repositories; chosen over ad-hoc flags to give a stable personalization layer.
- **Raw Terminal UI**: Implemented arrow-key navigation using `golang.org/x/term` for better ergonomics than numeric range entry; avoided external TUI deps to keep binary lean.
- **Auth Mode Selection**: Deterministic logic—if `bitbucket.username` (email) is set use Basic auth (personal API token); otherwise assume Bearer (resource access token). No fallback to prevent masking misconfiguration.
- **Command Scope Change**: Existing PR commands (`list`, `mine`, new `participating`) default to watched repos aggregation when no `--repo` is supplied, improving daily workflow efficiency.
- **Non-breaking Introduction**: Behavior change gated only by presence of watch list; clear errors if user attempts watched-only operations with empty list.

## Implementation Summary
Implemented watch management subcommands, interactive selection, and modified PR-related commands to operate on a configurable watched set. Added a new participating command to surface PRs where the user is involved beyond authorship. Enhanced Bitbucket client with participating query method and auth selection logic. Updated README with detailed keybindings and usage examples.

## Technical Details
### New Components
- **`cmd/bitbucket_watch.go`**: Subcommands `add`, `remove`, `toggle`, `list` for watch list management.
- **Interactive UI (in `bitbucket_list_repos.go`)**: Raw-mode terminal handling for arrow keys, paging, selection, and immediate persistence.
- **`GetParticipatingPullRequests`**: Client method building a filtered Bitbucket API query for participation.

### Modified Components
- **`internal/config/config.go`**: Added `WatchedRepos` slice; serialization updates.
- **`cmd/bitbucket_list.go`**: Now validates/aggregates watched repos; added helper to print grouped PRs.
- **`cmd/bitbucket_my_prs.go`**: Aggregates across watched repos by default (unless `--all-repos` or explicit slug).
- **`cmd/bitbucket_participating.go`**: New aggregation logic mirroring list & mine semantics.
- **`cmd/bitbucket_list_repos.go`**: Replaced numeric batch toggle flow with arrow-key interactive mode; added autosave & legends.
- **`internal/bitbucket/client.go`**: Added auth mode decision and participating PR API method.
- **`README.md`**: Documented watch commands, interactive keymap, new scoping behavior, and auth selection logic.

## Files Modified/Created
- `cmd/bitbucket.go` – Registered `participating` command.
- `cmd/bitbucket_list.go` – Watched repo scoping / aggregation logic.
- `cmd/bitbucket_my_prs.go` – Watched aggregation & validation.
- `cmd/bitbucket_participating.go` – New command for participation listing.
- `cmd/bitbucket_list_repos.go` – Interactive raw terminal UI, autosave, watch markers.
- `cmd/bitbucket_watch.go` – Watch list CRUD commands.
- `internal/bitbucket/client.go` – Auth selection + `GetParticipatingPullRequests`.
- `internal/config/config.go` – Added `WatchedRepos` schema.
- `internal/bitbucket/auth_mode_test.go` – (Added placeholder test file for auth mode behavior).
- `go.mod`, `go.sum` – Added `golang.org/x/term` (and indirect `x/sys`).
- `README.md` – Updated documentation for new features & auth logic.
- `docs/sessions/2025-10-03-watched-repos-feature.md` – This summary.

## Tests Added
- `internal/bitbucket/auth_mode_test.go` scaffold (ensures future coverage for Basic vs Bearer selection). Full watch list and participation aggregation tests still pending.

## Configuration Changes
- Added JSON field: `bitbucket.watched_repos` (array of lowercase slugs). Persisted sorted for deterministic diffs.

## Documentation Updates
- README: Watched repo commands, interactive keys, updated PR command semantics, clarified Bitbucket auth modes & migration note.
- Session summary added here for traceability.

## Lessons Learned
- Raw terminal control via `golang.org/x/term` is sufficient for lightweight navigation without a full TUI framework.
- Clear separation of author vs participant queries improves user focus; aggregation drastically reduces repetitive manual repo flag usage.
- Deterministic auth logic avoids silent fallbacks that could mask token misconfiguration.

## Known Issues/TODOs
- Add unit tests for: watch list persistence, multi-repo aggregation, participating query edge cases.
- Optional flag to disable emojis/icons for plain text environments.
- Potential discrepancy between repository displayed `Name` and canonical slug (future normalization).
- Improve error messaging when Bitbucket API returns partial failures during aggregation.
- Consider caching repository pages to reduce repeated API calls in interactive mode.

## Next Steps
- Implement tests for watch management and participation logic.
- Normalize repo slug vs name (extract slug from API response if distinct).
- Add `--watched-only` optional flag for explicitness (currently implicit when no `--repo`).
- Provide summary counts (e.g., total open PRs) in `repo watch list`.

## Related Commits
- (Pending) Will bundle with commit introducing watched repos & participating aggregation.
