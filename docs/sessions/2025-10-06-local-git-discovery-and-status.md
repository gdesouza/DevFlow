# Session: Local Git Discovery & Status Command
**Date**: 2025-10-06
**Duration**: ~1.25 hours
**Participants**: User, Assistant

## Objectives
- Add `devflow git list` command for local repository discovery
- Provide consolidated sync/status view (branch, ahead/behind, dirty, upstream)
- Support both human-readable table and JSON output
- Avoid relying on external `git` executable for portability
- Implement parallel processing for performance across many repos

## Key Decisions
- **go-git Library**: Chosen to eliminate external process spawning and simplify cross-platform distribution.
- **Bounded Ancestor Traversal**: Implemented simple BFS up to 2000 commits each side for ahead/behind approximation (fast, good enough for typical repo sizes). Deferred true merge-base computation.
- **Concurrency**: Worker pool sized to `runtime.NumCPU()` (min 2) balances speed with resource usage.
- **Colorized Table (go-pretty)**: Provides readable, aligned output with conditional colorization only when stdout is a TTY.
- **Optional Fetch**: Default fetch (per-upstream remote) to keep data fresh; `--no-fetch` flag allows faster, offline snapshot.
- **Relative Paths**: Output paths relative to scan root to keep table concise.

## Implementation Summary
Introduced a new top-level `git` command group with a `list` subcommand. The command recursively walks a specified root directory to locate `.git` directories, evaluates each repository concurrently, optionally fetches the upstream for the current branch, determines tracking branch, computes approximate ahead/behind counts, detects dirty worktrees, and renders either a colorized table or structured JSON array.

## Technical Details
### New Components
- **`cmd/git_list.go`**: Implements discovery, concurrency, repo evaluation, output formatting.

### Notable Functions
- `discoverGitRepos`: Recursively finds repositories by locating `.git` directories.
- `evaluateRepo`: Opens repo with go-git, determines branch/upstream, optional fetch, dirty status, approximate ahead/behind via bounded ancestor BFS.
- `printRepoStatuses`: Renders table with colorized state and dirty indicators (TTY-aware).

## Files Modified/Created
- `cmd/git_list.go` – New command implementation.
- `README.md` – Added "Git Utilities" usage section with examples, state definitions, accuracy note.

## CLI Commands Added
```bash
devflow git list [--path <dir>] [--no-fetch] [--json]
```

### Flags
- `--path`, `-p`: Root directory to scan (default `.`)
- `--no-fetch`: Skip remote fetch (faster; may show stale upstream state)
- `--json`: Emit machine-readable JSON instead of table

## Output Fields
- `Repository`: Relative path to repo root
- `Branch`: Current branch or `DETACHED`
- `State`: One of `up-to-date`, `ahead`, `behind`, `diverged`, `no-upstream`, `detached`
- `Dirty`: `clean` or `dirty` (uncommitted changes)
- `Ahead` / `Behind`: Approximate commit counts vs upstream
- `Upstream`: Remote tracking reference (e.g. `origin/main`)

## Limitations / Accuracy Notes
- Ahead/behind counts use ancestor set difference (bounded to 2000 commits). Extremely large or highly divergent histories may cause minor count inaccuracies, but state classification remains correct.
- No filtering flags yet (e.g., only dirty or only diverged repos).
- No worker count configuration flag; auto-scaling may be refined later.

## Performance Considerations
- Single directory walk to discover repos; evaluation parallelized.
- Optional fetch only when an upstream is configured, minimizing network calls for detached or untracked branches.

## User Experience Improvements
- Single command provides panoramic view of local development state across many repos.
- Color-coded states improve at-a-glance assessment.
- JSON mode enables scripting / CI integration (e.g., detecting stale repos).

## Security Considerations
- No network authentication changes; fetches rely on existing git remote credentials already present in local git configuration.
- No storage of sensitive data; only reads repository metadata.

## Known Issues / TODOs
- Add precise merge-base computation for exact ahead/behind.
- Provide `--filter` options (e.g., `--dirty`, `--behind`, `--diverged`).
- Add `--workers` to tune concurrency; possibly auto-limit by repository count.
- Add `--max-commits` flag to override ancestor traversal bound.
- Consider `--no-color` or `--plain` for forced monochrome output.
- Unit tests for `evaluateRepo` logic (mock git repositories) not yet added.

## Next Steps
- Implement merge-base logic to refine counts.
- Add filtering and worker configurability.
- Introduce tests covering state classification and JSON output structure.

## Related Commits
- (Pending) Included with this session's commit introducing `git list`.

## Lessons Learned
- go-git sufficiently covers metadata needs; external `git` invocation unnecessary for this feature.
- Bounded traversal delivers acceptable accuracy/performance trade-off with minimal complexity.
- Relative path output improves readability for nested monorepo or multi-repo directories.

## Notes
Future enhancement: optional timing output to highlight slow repositories or network fetch delays.
