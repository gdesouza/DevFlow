# 2025-10-07 Jira Create Flags & Extended Issue Creation

## Summary
Implemented extended Jira issue creation functionality adding rich metadata flags to the `tasks create` command and expanding the Jira client to support optional fields (priority, labels, epic, story points, sprint, assignee, description via file or inline, and issue type). Updated README with comprehensive usage documentation.

## Objectives
- Add commonly needed creation flags for faster issue authoring
- Provide file-based description input for longer specs
- Keep implementation minimal while surfacing future Jira field customization needs

## Key Decisions
- Introduced `CreateIssueOptions` struct in the Jira client to avoid a growing parameter list and centralize future enhancements.
- Used widely common Jira Cloud custom field IDs (story points: `customfield_10016`, epic link: `customfield_10014`, sprint: `customfield_10020`) with clear README caveats instead of premature configurability.
- Chose to retain `name` for assignee mapping acknowledging some Jira Cloud instances require `accountId`; deferred full resolution API call complexity.

## Implementation Summary
- Extended client: refactored `CreateIssue` to accept an `opts` struct and conditionally include fields.
- Enhanced CLI: parsed and validated flags, handled mutual exclusivity of `--description` and `--description-file`, parsed comma-separated labels, and required `--project`.
- Documentation: Added full examples and flag reference to README.

## Technical Details
### New / Updated Components
- **`internal/jira/client.go`**: Added `CreateIssueOptions`, conditional field assembly, improved error messaging with response body.
- **`cmd/jira_create.go`**: Added flags, parsing helpers (`parseLabels`, `resolveDescription`), config loading, and issue creation output formatting.

### Flag Parsing
- Labels split on comma, trimmed, empty entries skipped.
- Description file path sanitized via `filepath.Clean` before read.
- Error path if both description sources provided.

## Files Modified/Created
- `internal/jira/client.go` - Added options struct & extended CreateIssue logic
- `cmd/jira_create.go` - Implemented new flags and creation flow
- `README.md` - Documented new flags & examples
- `docs/sessions/2025-10-07-jira-create-flags.md` - This session summary

## CLI Changes
### Modified Command
```bash
devflow tasks create -p <PROJECT> "Title" [flags]
```
New flags: `--project/-p`, `--type/-t`, `--priority`, `--assignee`, `--labels`, `--epic`, `--story-points`, `--sprint`, `--description/-d`, `--description-file`.

## API Integration Details
- Endpoint used: `POST /rest/api/3/issue`
- Authentication: Basic (email/username + API token) already established in existing client.
- Conditional JSON field injection avoids sending empty/null fields.

## Documentation Updates
- README task creation section expanded with examples, flag list, caveats about custom field IDs & assignee limitations.

## User Experience Improvements
- Single command now covers common creation use cases (previously manual web UI step).
- Clear failure messaging surfaces raw response when non-201 returned.

## Security Considerations
- No new persistence of secrets; continues using config-loaded credentials.
- File-based description reads local files only (no remote fetch introduced).

## Known Issues / TODOs
- Custom field IDs are instance-specific; need future configurability (`devflow config set jira.field.story_points customfield_XXXXX`).
- Assignee may require `accountId` lookup; future enhancement: add lightweight user search endpoint call.
- Epic / Sprint linkage may fail silently if field IDs differâ€”enhanced validation could preflight request.

## Next Steps
- Add optional verbose flag to echo raw JSON payload for debugging.
- Introduce configurable custom field IDs via config file.
- Implement `tasks create --interactive` mode with prompt-based field selection.
- Add tests for flag parsing and CreateIssueOptions construction (current session skipped test additions for speed).

## Lessons Learned
- Keeping options aggregated simplifies future extension vs. multiple function overloads.
- Early user documentation is critical when relying on assumed custom field IDs.

## Notes
Consider adding a lightweight validation endpoint call (e.g., GET issue meta) to dynamically map field IDs before creating issues to reduce reliance on hardcoded custom field identifiers.
