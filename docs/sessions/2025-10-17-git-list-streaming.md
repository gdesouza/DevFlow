# Session: Git List Streaming & Tabular Mode Flag
**Date**: 2025-10-17
**Duration**: ~20 minutes
**Participants**: solo

## Objectives
- Introduce streaming output as default for `git list` to improve responsiveness on large directory scans.
- Add `--tabular` flag to retain full table rendering when desired.
- Update README documentation and bump version to `v1.3.1`.

## Key Decisions
- Default mode: stream each repository line immediately (`path<TAB>branch<TAB>state`) for quicker feedback.
- Table and JSON modes: only activated when `--tabular` or `--json` flags are present to avoid waiting for all repos in default usage.
- Version bump to `v1.3.1` treated as feature enhancement (non-breaking change).

## Implementation Summary
Added `gitListTabular` flag and conditional output logic in `cmd/git_list.go`. When neither `--json` nor `--tabular` is specified, results print as they finish processing. Existing table generation logic extracted into `printRepoStatuses` remains unchanged for tabular mode.

## Technical Details
- Concurrency: Workers (NumCPU, min 2) process repositories and send `gitRepoStatus` structs via channel.
- Streaming path: results channel consumed dynamically; each item printed on arrival; skips final aggregation and sorting (fast path).
- Tabular/JSON path: waits for all workers, aggregates, sorts by path for deterministic ordering.
- README updated to describe new default and provide examples for streaming vs tabular.

## Files Modified/Created
- `cmd/git_list.go` (added `gitListTabular` flag, streaming branch logic)
- `README.md` (Git Utilities section updated with streaming explanation and examples)
- `cmd/version.go` (bumped version to `v1.3.1`)
- `docs/sessions/2025-10-17-git-list-streaming.md` (this summary)

## CLI Changes
```bash
# Streaming (default)
./devflow git list

# Full table (waits for completion)
./devflow git list --tabular

# JSON output
./devflow git list --json
```

## User Experience Improvements
- Faster initial feedback on large monorepos or deep directory trees.
- Clear optional path to rich tabular visualization without sacrificing responsiveness.

## Performance Considerations
- Streaming mode reduces perceived latency; overall throughput unchanged.
- Sorting omitted in streaming mode for speed; deterministic ordering preserved in tabular/JSON modes.

## Tests Added
- None in this session (future: add tests around evaluation logic and streaming branch via refactor to injectable writer).

## Known Issues / TODOs
- Streaming output currently minimal (no dirty/ahead/behind counts). Potential enhancement: optional extended streaming columns.
- No timing metrics surfaced; could add `--stats` flag to print total repos and duration.
- Ahead/behind computation remains approximate; documented in README.

## Next Steps
- Add unit tests for repo evaluation and state classification.
- Consider `--columns` flag for customizable output.
- Add `--stats` or `--progress` for large scans.

## Related Commits
- (Pending commit for this session) feat(git): streaming default output with optional --tabular; bump version v1.3.1

## Notes
Streaming improves ergonomics for daily status checks while preserving structured outputs for deeper review or scripting.
